      - title: swe @ youtube
      - title: i'm currently interested math, physics, software engineering, algorithms, comedy, chess, piano, and philosphy. despite all these interests, i'm still dumb as rocks!
      - title: i loved a few video games growing up, and i run a youtube channel where i talk about anything on my mind
  - title: <b>why a blog?</b>
    entries:
      - title: i'd like to become better at articulating my thoughts. a blog helps me do that sometimes
      - title: i think our society has become deeply unhappy because we indulge far more than ever before. i believe most people would be happier if they spent their time creating more and consuming less
      - title: this blog is one way i can exercise that belief - an area to create, not consume. i might not be the most creative (far from it), but i believe that creating and maintaining a blog is (narrowly) a better use of my time than, say, watching 5 youtube shorts about whether or not the new chick-fil-a fries are any good (they aren't)
      - title: damn would ya get a load of this guy? who asked!
  - title: <b>things i'll probably put on here (my little todo list)</b>

      - title: a tab for books that i'm currently reading, have read, and my opinion on them
      - title: a tab for a weight tracker (i want to put my weight on my public website if that's not clear)
      - title: maybe a tab for piano recordings
      - title: random thoughts/opinions on things
      - title: writeups or discussions of various algorithms, maths, or physics problems that i come across
