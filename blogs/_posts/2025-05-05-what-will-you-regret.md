title: What will you regret?
---

### Quick aside

I created and pushed a post pretty recently, and now I'm creating another post today. I don't see this becoming a daily habit, but I will say that having an outlet is pretty nice. I think expressing myself through these posts gives me some momentum for thinking about other things in my life.

### Long term planning

I've been thinking about long term planning recently. How often do most people do the same thing every day and follow through on it? How many people do you know religiously go to the gym? Or how many people do you know go to bed at the same time every day? What about people who consistently eat healthily?

I don't know many people who do that. But the people who I *do* know who do that are usually respected. LeBron James (the üêê) has the same routine for NBA games and for workouts and look where it got him. My dad has a routine where he wakes up early every morning and does yoga, goes to work, and then comes back and exercises and by all means, he is very successful. I have a close friend (who I won't name for privacy) who was great about having a routine, and he's someone who I really respect as well.

Of course there are outliers, but it really seems like one thing, <span class="highlighted">*consistency*</span> (or maybe another word, <span class="highlighted">*conscientiousness*</span>), is what determines someone's success.

### Does a plan really help anything?

I read <span class="highlighted">*Atomic Habits*</span> by James Clear in 2021. I don't usually read self-help books, but this one got some great reviews online. When I initially read the book, I too thought it was great. The general idea is to achieve your goals, you need to form habits that build towards your goal. To achieve your habits, you "Make them obvious", "Make them attractive", "Make them easy", and "Make them satisfying". For a while even, I implemented these ideas into my own life with decent success!

But then one day, I just stopped. I don't remember why or when, but I did. I constantly attempt to get back on track, but each time, my steam fell off quicker than the last.

Why does that happen? I thought I had figured it out! I had all the steps - I made my habits easy, I made my habits attractive, I made my habits obivous, and I made my habits satisfying. Why does it seem like even if I put all this effort into achieving a specific goal, I'm not able to accomplish it? And what differentiates me from my dad, or my friend, or LeBron (other than the fact that he is LeBron God Damn James)?


### Regret

From my experience, I think having a plan (or process, like the habit process specified above), while it's important, doesn't guarantee any form of success. It might be a *prerequisite* for some people -- but simply having a plan doesn't really make any progress towards your goal. Another way to think about it: if having a long-term plan was what separated consistent people from inconsistent people, then consistency and goal-achievement would be far more common. It's *easy* to create long term plans. Anyone can do that. So why do some people succeed and why do some people fail?

When you have a goal, you usually have a rough idea of what you need to do (at least for simple goals like "get in shape" or "excel at my career"). Even when you don't plan something out, you probably have a rough idea on what you need to do, at least in the short-term. To become a better runner, I know that I just have to run a lot. To become a better coder, I know that I need to code a lot (and read code a lot too). To accomplish x, you need to do x. You get the point.

It's not like a math problem or a clever puzzle or anything. There's no "trick" or clever solution. The answer is "just do it" (Nike!).

So, again, why don't we just do the things we need to do? Well, the things we need to do to achieve our goals often put us out of our comfort zone. If you need to eat healthy and exercise, both of those things aren't as pleasant as eating junk food and not exercising. But there's a catch - they're not as pleasant in the *short-term*, but in the *long-term*, they will be! And another thing: there is some short-term pain you feel when you don't do the things you need to do -- <span class="highlighted">regret</span>.

I think people who are consistent are masters of the mindset "If I don't do this, I know I am going to regret it in the future". This is a form of long-term thinking. You're planning about what future-you is going to think after you don't perform the action. They're masters of regret -- they know exactly how to minimize it.

### Impulsivity

When you don't do the thing you need to do, you're being impulsive and irrational. You have to think about it your goals like: "I could give you $0.0001 today or $1million dollars in 6 months." Of course, with money, it's easy -- just take the million in the 6 months! If you took the $0.0001 today, in 6 months time, you'd feel like "Damn it, why didn't I just wait for 6 months?"

It comes down to impulsivity. You're not being rational, you want to feel good *now*. You're not thinking about you 6 months down the line. For me, it's like when I see fast food, I'll be like "I want to feel good now". It's not about me in 6 months. It's about the now. But it's not rational!

### None of this matters anyway

I'll say one more thing about this because I think the ideas that I'm putting out aren't particularly insightful. The people who I know who are successful keep their "todo list" or their "habit tracking" or whatever "process" for goal accomplishment very simple. It's usually one list or a piece of paper they write on every day or whatever. There's no process or insane note-taking system or whatever. It's just, "I need to do x", or "I will set a reminder to do x on day y".

There's no big overhead. Of course, you and I could be different, but since this process of getting super into productivity workflows instead of actually being productive is extremely common, maybe it wouldn't hurt to take a simpler approach towards productivity workflows.

The only thing that matters is that, if you need to *x*, then just do *x*. Calibrate along the way. It's simple, not easy.

### So what are my goals?

Let's start simple. I want to get in great shape. One goal, comprised of 3 steps:

1. Eat healthy. No fast food, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, fruits, water, and maybe 1-2 sweets a day.
2. Exercise a lot. Lift Mon, Wed, Friday, Sat. Cardio (basketball if possible) Tues, Wed, Thurs, Sat. Sunday stretching. If no exercise for the day (a rest day), a brisk 30 minute walk is required.
3. Sleep 7-9 quality at the same time every night - 1am.
4. Meditation 30 mins each day.

My goal weight is 150lbs. I don't have particular strength goals or cardio goals. The plan is laid out. Now all I gotta do is just do it.
