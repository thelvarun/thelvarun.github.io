### I feel behind

In many ways I feel behind when compared to my peers. I don't really have a strong identity for who I am. It feels like everyone around me does.

I often feel like I'm too picky for most things. I don't want to do *x* because I'm not super-into it or becacuse I don't mesh well with others who are into it. I don't want to do *y* because I feel silly doing it. But really, I don't want "others" to define me by a group that I associate with. That shouldn't be the case -- I shouldn't care about how others view me.

One of the things that consuming content online does is that it distracts you from understanding who you are. If you can watch a YouTube video from your favorite streamer, you don't have to have your own opinions or thoughts. There's a line where you can cross between enjoying someone's content and using content as a distraction from real life problems. I think I've easily crossed the line into distraction.

If you don't know who you are, neither will others. It's your job to figure that out. Do it unapologetically! Fuck it! Come at things with a good attitude.

I have a weird suspicion that it's because I think too highly of myself. If the question I ask myself is "Are *these* the people I want to associate with?", then it really sounds like I think I'm above meeting the people who I meet. That's a problem.

I think the only that I can do is go into every interaction with the sole intention of interaction. No judgement. I need a true appreciation for life.

### To summarize

This post was less of a structured piece with a point and more just thoughts that flew into my mind why writing this. To summarize, my action items are:
- Come to life with a good attitude. Fake it 'til you make it.
- Develop interests in new things unapologetically.
- You have to figure out who you are. There's no one else to tell you what to do. That's what makes life interesting. You have the reins.
