  <li>Indulgence Kills Happiness.</li>
  <li>What do I define as indulgence?</li>
</ol>

<p>When we indulge, we allow ourselves to feel some sort of pleasure. We allow ourselves to become immersed something enjoyable.</p>

<p>When I eat a hamburger with french fries, I’m indulging myself in the pleasures of greasy, fatty, salty foods.
When I decide to sleep in on a day where I’m supposed to wake up and perform chores, I’m indulging myself in the pleasure of laziness.
When I drink a little too much, I’m indulging myself in the effects of intoxication.
Honestly, when I think of the word “indulgence”, a cartoonish image of someone enjoying wine, cheese, crackers, and fruits appears in my head.</p>

<p>Indulgence on it’s own doesn’t make you unhappy. In fact, for many, you might claim that indulgence creates happiness. By allowing one’s self to indulge, you could claim that you’re allowing yourself to feel life’s greatest pleasures – which makes you feel <em>good</em>. However, there is a distinction between happiness and “feeling good.”</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is happiness?</li>
</ol>

<p>Something I’ve been thinking about recently is what “happiness” truly means.</p>

<p>When someone says that they’re happy, what does that mean? Can you be happy but in pain? Can you be happy but with low energy and fatigue? Is happiness a mindset? Is happiness a mood – could I be happy and feel sad at the same time?</p>

<p>Here’s a thought experiment: If I were given a genie that would grant any wish, would I end up happy? Well obviously – I would just wish for happiness! But what does that mean? What would the genie do? Maybe the genie would fulfill all my deepest desires. But… I don’t think that would be the case:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Why does constant indulgence kill happiness?</li>
</ol>

<p>By indulging yourself constantly, you don’t let yourself forget. Your brain gets used to the indulgence, similar to how a drug addict needs more hits to keep the high going. If you ate a burger and fries for 100 days straight, you’d probably hate burgers and fries by the end of it (granted you haven’t died from a heart attack).</p>

<p>Now, more than ever, we indulge.</p>

<p>Bored? There is literally an infinite stream of content on the Internet, of any variety. You have your phone, which you can use to consume all this content, constantly.</p>

<p>Hungry? We have engineered the best tasting foods possible that are available with the tap of a button on your phone.</p>

<p>Lonely? You can go on any social media and scroll endlessly, feeling like you’re part of something social. There are Twitch streamers that act like your friend and will read your chat messages and reply to you. There are even AI bots that you can talk to.</p>

<p>The problem is that the opposite of indulgence is effort - discomfort. Being bored is not a pleasurable state to be in. If your bored, most people don’t choose to read a book - this takes effort and why would I expend any effort at all when I can watch my favorite TV show, or watch 58 Youtube Shorts? If your hungry, why do through the effort to make your own food (maybe even healthy food), when you can just purchase it. If you’re lonely, why try to make friends and reach out when you can sit at home and be comfortable.</p>

<p>As the old saying goes – no pain, no gain.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Is there a balance?</li>
</ol>

<p>To be clear, I’m not saying that you should always choose the hard way of doing things.</p>

<p>Maybe convenience is a better word than indulgence.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indulgence Kills Happiness. What do I define as indulgence?]]></summary></entry></feed>
